# The summary line:

# - Restrict to 50 characters.
# - Must be followed by a blank line.

# On its own, it should read like a command. It should also make sense
# when inserted into the following sentence:
#
#     "This commit will <summary line>."

# For commits to meta-* layers
# ----------------------------
# Conform to the guidelines on the wiki, at
#

[GF-9999] Summary

#
# This template lays out the required form for all commit messages. At a
# future time, gerrit will automatically verify the format and reject
# commits which do not conform.
#
# Observe the following general rules.
#
# - DO visit https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages for an
#      excellent commentary on commit message content.
# - DO leave all comment lines (beginning with a '#') in place. They
#      will not appear in the commit message. Feel free to delete the
#      comments once you are comfortable with the format.
# - DO Wrap all lines other than the summary line, an possibly JIRA
#      refrences, at 72 characters.
# - DO Reference all JIRAs. There are two formats you can use to
#      reference JIRA. References in the form [GF-9999] will be picked
#      up in the  release notes. References in the form GF-9999 will not.
#
# - DO NOT delete blank lines in the template
# - DO NOT delete lines containing section markers (:<text>:)
# - DO NOT put waffle in any section. It will appear in the release
#          notes, probably with your name attached.
